## Description
Welcome to my E-commerce backend project running on SQL using sequelize models, express, and mysql2! you get a database with products, tags, categories, and product tags. All 4 tables are connected with their respective IDs and you are able to GET, PUT, and DELETE each table as you please. Check out the video walkthrough below for in depth functionality example
